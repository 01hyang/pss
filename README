Introduction: what is pss?
--------------------------

You can think of **pss** as an enhanced **grep** designed to search inside source code files.
**pss** is very similar to the Perl **ack** tool (see
https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pss/wiki/PssAndAck).

Installing
----------

When you unzip the source distribution, run::

    > python setup.py install

How to use it?
--------------

**pss** is meant to be executed from the command line. Running it with no arguments or with
``-h`` will print a detailed usage message. 

For some detailed usage examples, check out the 
Usage wiki page - https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pss/wiki/Usage.

Pre-requisites
--------------

**pss** needs only Python to run. It works with with Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 on
Linux and Windows (though I don't see a reason it shouldn't work on other platforms as
well).
