Implementation notes
--------------------

string vs. bytes handling, Python 2 & Python 3
==============================================

To enable sane code with minimal Python 2 & 3 deviations, all files are read
in binary mode ('rb') before being passed to ContentMatcher.

On the other hand, since the colorama library (especially on Windows) is 
sensitive to the type of output, all output emitted by DefaultOutputFormatter
is done as a string (unicode on Python 3).
